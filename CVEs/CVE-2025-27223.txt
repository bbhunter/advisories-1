1. ADVISORY INFORMATION
=======================
Product:        TRUfusion Enterprise
Vendor URL:     https://www.rocketsoftware.com/en-us/products/b2b-supply-chain-integration/trufusion
CWE:            Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key [CWE-321]
Date found:     2025-02-12
Date published: 2025-09-30
CVSSv4 Score:   9.3 (CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:H/VA:N/SC:H/SI:H/SA:H)
CVE:            CVE-2025-27223


2. CREDITS
==========
This vulnerability was discovered and researched by Julien Ahrens from
RCE Security.


3. VERSIONS AFFECTED
====================
TRUfusion Enterprise <= 7.10.4.0


4. INTRODUCTION
===============
TRUfusion Enterprise is a simple, cost-effective complementary solution for companies
using CAD and PLM systems such as Siemens NX and Teamcenter®, PTC Creo and Windchill™,
and Dassault Systemes CATIA, allowing you to easily and securely manage the exchange 
of CAD files and related product design data from within your PLM system.

(from the vendor's homepage)


5. VULNERABILITY DETAILS
========================
A part of the TRUfusion software relies on the encrypted cookies "COOKIEID" and 
"ADMINCOOKIEID" as an authentication mechanism for some endpoints, such as 
"/trufusionPortal/getProjectList". However, the application uses the static key 
"1234567890123456" to create the encrypted cookie, ultimately allowing anyone to forge 
cookies for any user.

Successful exploits can allow an unauthenticated attacker to gain access to any user's 
account.
